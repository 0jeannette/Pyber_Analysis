# Pyber_Analysis

Using Matplotlib to tell a visual story about ride sharing data

Overview of analysis:

As a data scientist for Pyber, a ride-sharing app, I was tasked with conducting an exploratory analysis using several types of visualizations to tell a story about the data and to address disparities. Initial analyses and visualizations were so successful that I was tasked with providing additional data comprising of ride-sharing data by city type.

Results

Rides in rural areas are fewer but higher in average fare per ride. Urban rides have a lower average fare per ride but accounts for the majority of rideshare income based on the other types of cites. There seems to be a higher demand for drivers in rural and suburban cities.

Summary

Three (3) recommendations to the CEO to address any disparities among the city types:

1.	Increasing the number of drivers in Rural areas to ensure we meet demand. 
2.	Increasing the number of drivers in Suburban areas to ensure we meet demand.
3.	Decreasing the number of drivers in Urban areas since there is less of a need.
